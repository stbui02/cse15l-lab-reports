Hello everyone,

Hey everyone,

I've been working on this Java program, ProductCalculator, and I'm encountering an issue.
When I run the program, it gives me an unexpected result for the product of the numbers.
I think there might be a bug in my calculateProduct method because the product is always coming out as zero, even though the numbers in the input file are not all zeros.
I'm not sure what's causing this. I'll paste some images of the output below. Any help would be appreciated!
