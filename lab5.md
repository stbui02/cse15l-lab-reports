Hello everyone,

I'm working on a Java program called `productCalculator`, which reads numbers from a file and calculates their product. However, when I run the program, it always returns a product of 1, even though there are numbers in the file `numbers.txt`. I believe there's a bug in my code related to calculating the product.

Here's a screenshot of the output I'm getting:

Can anyone help me identify and fix the bug?

Thanks!
